# Compass Project Prepared for WordPress

This repo was made in order to get a starting point for a WordPress theme styled via SASS and Compass. 
In a standard Compass project the .scss files are placed in the /sass folder. 
However WordPress needs the style.css in the root folder. 

# config.rb - Compass Configuration

The file *config.rb* defines the whereabouts of certain directories. 

WordPress needs a *style.css* file in the root of the theme folder.
Therefore *config.rb* should look like this:

~~~~
http_path = "/"
css_dir = ""
sass_dir = "sass"
images_dir = "images"
javascripts_dir = "javascripts"
~~~~


## style.css for a theme

Here's a style.css sample for this WordPress theme:

# The Loop

* Codex: [The Loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop)
* See: [Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/the-wordpress-loop-explained-for-beginners)

Here's a loop sample from the page above:

~~~~
if (have_posts()) :
   while (have_posts()) :
      the_post();
         the_content();
   endwhile;
endif;
?>
~~~~

More elaborate loops are possible, have a look at the loops in e.g. the *twentyfifteen*, *twentyfourteen* and other themes.
