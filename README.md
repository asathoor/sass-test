# Compass Project Prepared for WordPress

In this clone of a typical Compass project, I have prepared for the production of either a typical WordPress theme or child theme.
Edit style css accordingly. 

# config.rb - Compass Configuration

The file *config.rb* defines the whereabouts of certain directories. 

WordPress needs a *style.css* file in the root of the theme folder.
Therefore *config.rb* should look like this:

~~~~
http_path = "/"
css_dir = ""
sass_dir = "sass"
images_dir = "images"
javascripts_dir = "javascripts"
~~~~

## style.css for a theme

Here's a style.css sample for a WordPress theme:
~~~~
